# Musical-Mechanical-Calculator
Mechatronics project that uses an Arduino to roll a user-specified number of balls down a ramp.
The user can press buttons for "1", "2", "3", "+", "=", or "Clear" on a small solderless breadboard.
A piezo-electric buzzer plays different tones depending on the button pressed.
It plays a C natural once when "1" is pressed, a D natural twice when "2" is pressed, and so on.
An LED light goes off after the equals button is pressed and blinks corresponding to the product.
For example, if the user enters 1 + 3 = , the LED will blink four times.
Two servo motors allow four balls to roll down the short wooden ramp.
Processing displays the buttons clicked and how many balls will roll down the screen.
The Java processing program also shows the balls rolling down the screen.
Here is a short video showing the final product:
